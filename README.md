This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## The Application â€“ Food Delivery for Shippers

This is a web application designed for shippers to manage and deliver food orders efficiently.

It has some basic function: 
- Authentication: Login, sign up, forget password.
- Order Delivery: View and take delivery orders, real-time delivery status, integrated map view for navigation, chat with customers or store (restaurant).
- Personal information: update personal details, change password.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
